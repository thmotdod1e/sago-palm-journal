# Case Study: Chlorosis on Sago Palm #3

## Plant Details
- **ID:** Sago Palm #3
- **Location:** East patio (morning sun, afternoon shade)
- **Potting:** Container with well-draining mix
- **Age:** Approximately 5 years

## Initial Observation (Week 1)
**Date:** December 27, 2025

**Symptoms:**
- Newest fronds showing interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins)
- Veins remain dark green
- No signs of pest infestation (no scale, mites, or webbing)
- Older fronds appear healthy and green
- Soil surface appears moist

**Hypothesis:**
Potential manganese deficiency, common in cycads grown in alkaline soils or with poor nutrient availability.

**Planned Action:**
1. Perform soil pH test (pending)
2. Apply chelated manganese supplement as per package instructions.
3. Monitor plant response over the next 2–3 weeks.

**Treatment Applied:**
- Chelated manganese (10% Mn-EDTA) at recommended rate (1 tsp per gallon)
- Applied as soil drench around root zone
- Watered lightly after application to help incorporation

**Next Observation:** Scheduled for January 3, 2026.

## Week 2 Observation (One week after treatment)
**Date:** January 3, 2026

**Findings:**
- No significant change in chlorosis observed; new fronds remain yellow
- Soil pH test result: pH 7.2 (slightly alkaline)
- Soil moisture check: soil felt consistently damp, even though watering had been reduced
- No signs of pest activity
- Plant otherwise appears healthy, no wilting or leaf drop

**Assessment:**
Manganese deficiency less likely given lack of improvement and adequate soil pH for nutrient availability. Suspect overwatering may be contributing to poor root function and nutrient uptake.

**Updated Plan:**
1. Reduce watering frequency further; allow soil to dry out between waterings (top 1-2 inches dry)
2. Improve drainage by adding perlite to surface and ensuring drainage holes are clear
3. Hold off on further manganese applications
4. Monitor for improvement over next week.

**Next Observation:** Scheduled for January 10, 2026.

## Week 3 Observation (After adjusting watering)
**Date:** January 10, 2026

**Findings:**
- Soil moisture has decreased; top 2 inches now dry before watering
- Drainage improved by adding perlite and clearing drainage holes
- No visible improvement in chlorosis yet, but no worsening either
- New growth emerging appears slightly greener at the base but still pale
- Roots inspected during perlite addition: no signs of rot, but root mass seemed somewhat limited

**Assessment:**
Overwatering appears to have been a contributing factor. The plant may be recovering slowly. Need to continue proper watering schedule and allow time for new healthy growth.

**Updated Action:**
- Continue reduced watering schedule (water only when top 2 inches are dry)
- Add a balanced, slow-release fertilizer (NPK 8-2-12 plus micronutrients) at half strength to support overall nutrition
- Monitor for signs of improvement over next 2 weeks

**Next Observation:** Scheduled for January 24, 2026.
